# Problem 1

## Data import and clean

Import data, create the city_state variable, and filter unwanted states:

``` r
homicides = read_csv("local_files/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = na_if(victim_age, "Unknown"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) |>
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !is.na(victim_age)
  )
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon

## Baltimore model

First get the data for Baltimore:

``` r
baltimore =
  homicides |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
```

Use glm function to fit a logistic regression model. Treating resolved
vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors.

``` r
baltimore_fit = glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
      family = binomial, data = baltimore)

baltimore_or = baltimore_fit |>
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)

baltimore_or
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 7
    ##   term             estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>               <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)         1.36    0.171        1.81 7.04e- 2    0.976     1.91 
    ## 2 victim_age          0.993   0.00332     -2.02 4.30e- 2    0.987     1.000
    ## 3 victim_sexMale      0.426   0.138       -6.18 6.26e-10    0.324     0.558
    ## 4 victim_raceWhite    2.32    0.175        4.82 1.45e- 6    1.65      3.28

Now if we look at the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted
odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male to female alone:

``` r
baltimore_or |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 7
    ##   term           estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale    0.426     0.138     -6.18 6.26e-10    0.324     0.558

We can see that the conf interval of the adjusted OR is (0.324, 0.558)
and the estimate OR is 0.426. We can say the odds that a homicide is
solved are about 0.574 lower for male victims than female victims in
Baltimore.

## All cities model

Similarly, we use glm function to fit a model for all cities and look at
the estimate and confidence interval of OR for solving homicides
comparing male to female alone:

``` r
city_or =
  homicides |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  nest() |>
  mutate(
    fit = purrr::map(data, ~ glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
                                 family = binomial, data = .x)),
    results = purrr::map(fit, ~ broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE))
  ) |>
  select(city_state, results) |>
  unnest(results) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")

city_or
```

## Plotting

Plot the OR and confidence interval for each city based our previous
result:

``` r
city_or_plot =
  city_or |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, estimate), y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "City",
    y = "Adjusted OR",
    title = "Adjusted odds of a homicide being solved (male vs female)"
  )

city_or_plot
```

![](p8105_hw6_yw4665_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that Albuquerque, NM has the highest adjusted OR and New
York, NY has the lowest adjusted OR, while a higher adjusted OR means
bigger chance a homicide is solved for male than female in that city.
Note that all cities except the top 5 have a OR \< 1, this means a
homicide is more likely to be solved for female victims than male
victims in most cities.
